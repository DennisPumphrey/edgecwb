# edgecwb This project is for the Edge/CWB code used at the National Information Earthquake Center for acquiring, storing and support
query for seismic waveforms and to archive them.  This project is fairly large as it encompasses many projects comprising the full 
software used at the NEIC including post processing and status gathering.  The greatly simplified view is this software can gather
seismic waveform from many places and hold them in files for later use.
