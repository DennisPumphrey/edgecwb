# EdgeCWB

EdgeCWB is a software suite developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) that supports multi-protocol waveform acquisition, short-term storage, and data product return. "Edge" refers to a special configuration of a Unix operating system to operate as a network node. "CWB" refers to a Continuous Waveform Buffer which is a method of long-term archival and access of seismic data. The EdgeCWB software allows a computer to collect seismic data and simultaneously serve as a redundant archive.
